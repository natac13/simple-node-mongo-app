I followed along the Clementine.js [beginner tutorial](http://www.clementinejs.com/tutorials/tutorial-beginner.html). The reason was to get an understanding of how the [second tutorial](http://www.clementinejs.com/tutorials/tutorial-passport.html) about authO works. 

At this time I am working through my [vegan recipe app](https://vegan-recipes.firebaseapp.com/) which uses Firebase as the database and also for authentication. [Passport.js][] seems to handle this with an node.js application. Therefore working through the second Clementine tutorial I hope to gain a staring knowledge then move to the [Passport docs][]
